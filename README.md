Heart Disease Prediction Project

This project uses machine learning to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on various clinical features. By analyzing patient data, this project aims to provide a model that can assist healthcare professionals in identifying high-risk individuals early, allowing for timely interventions.

Project Overview
Heart disease is a leading cause of death worldwide, and early detection is critical for effective treatment. In this project, we utilize various machine learning algorithms to develop a predictive model for heart disease diagnosis, exploring techniques such as Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Random Forest Classifier. The project is structured to showcase the end-to-end process of building a predictive model, from data cleaning to model evaluation.

Key Objectives
Data Exploration: Analyze the dataset to understand relationships between features and identify key predictors of heart disease.
Data Preprocessing: Prepare data by handling missing values, normalizing features, and splitting data into training and testing sets.
Model Training: Train multiple machine learning models to compare their predictive performance.
Model Evaluation: Evaluate models based on accuracy, confusion matrices, and classification metrics to select the best-performing model.
Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains various medical attributes (such as age, cholesterol levels, and blood pressure) and a target variable indicating the presence of heart disease. It is suitable for classification tasks and provides a robust basis for testing predictive models.

Project Workflow
Data Loading: Load and inspect the dataset for structure, missing values, and basic statistics.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualize correlations and distributions of key features to gain insights into the data.
Data Preprocessing:
Split data into features and target variable.
Perform train-test split to ensure robust model evaluation.
Standardize feature values to enhance model performance.
Model Training:
Train Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Random Forest models on the dataset.
Predict heart disease presence based on testing data.
Model Evaluation:
Assess accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix for each model.
Compare model performances to identify the most accurate predictor.
Results
The Random Forest model, typically robust for classification tasks, tends to perform the best in terms of accuracy and reliability, though other models provide useful benchmarks. The project provides insights into the effectiveness of different machine learning algorithms for heart disease prediction.

Conclusion
This heart disease prediction project demonstrates how machine learning can be used to analyze medical data and provide predictive insights. The findings could help healthcare providers make more informed decisions and potentially improve patient outcomes through early detection.
